# Automate-an-E-Commerce-Web-Application


DESCRIPTION

To automate a real-world web application

 

Description:

Flipkart is an e-commerce platform, and they have launched a new feature to search for a product in a particular category. Once the product is searched, Flipkart displays it as a list of product items. To enhance the performance of the application, Flipkart has implemented lazy loading. It displays only a few products that can come on the screen.

To display or load more products, the user must scroll down.

As a Test Engineer, you are expected to test this feature end-to-end.

 

Detailed Scenario:

Navigate to the Flipkart homepage (https://www.flipkart.com/)
Determine a page load time with a performance test
Search for a product, say, “iPhone 13” under the “Mobile” category
Check if the images are loaded and visible till the screen height only
Check if the page has a scroll feature
Check the frequency at which the content will be refreshed while scrolling
Verify that the image is downloaded just before the user scrolls to its position and gets displayed in time
Verify that it navigates to the bottom of the page
Check whether different browsers and screen resolutions render it the same way
 

Tools Required:

Selenium Library
Eclipse IDE
TestNG Library
Maven
